# NumericSequenceCalculator
Web application to compute numeric sequences

##How to run

To simplify the process, I have upload the whole visual studio project to the gitHub repository.

1. Download the project (clone via gitHub) or direct download [link](https://github.com/Galardolind/NumericSequenceCalculator/archive/master.zip)
2. 
  a. (optional)Unzip
  b. Open Visual Studio (I use Visual Studio Community 2015 v 14.0)
  c. Click on 'Open project' then choose the 'NumericSequenceCalculator.sln' file
3. Click on F5 (by default) to run the application
4. The application is ready to be used

##Run the tests

Simply press Ctrl+R then A, to run the tests (should be 36 valid tests).

##UI tests  

To create UI tests, the Enterprise version of Visual Community is needed... the version cost about 6.000$...so not yet...
