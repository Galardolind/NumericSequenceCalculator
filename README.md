To simplify the process, I have upload the whole visual studio project to the gitHub repository.(The process to deploy is explained on UI Test part)

1. Download the project (clone via gitHub) or direct download [link](https://github.com/Galardolind/NumericSequenceCalculator/archive/master.zip)
2. Proceed as following
  1. (optional)Unzip
  2. Open Visual Studio (I use Visual Studio Community 2015 v 14.0)
  3. Click on 'Open project' then choose the 'NumericSequenceCalculator.sln' file
3. Click on F5 (by default) to run the application
4. The application is ready to be used

##UI tests  && Unit Tests

To Run the UI tests, you need to deploy the application. To do the UI tests I have used the IIS and Selenium.

1. Open the project
2. Click on Build (The top menu) â†’ Publish NumericSequenceCalculator
3. Do the configuration to make it work with your own IIS (If you are not familiar with it follow [this tutorial](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd465337%28v=vs.110%29)
4. Once your web server is ready to work you just need to run All the test ( Ctrl+R, A )
